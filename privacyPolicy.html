    <h1>🔒 Privacy Policy - Audition Toolkit</h1>
    <p class="poetic">
      🎵 "Every note you tune, every voice you shape, every beat you create —  
      Audition Toolkit protects it as if it were our own heartbeat." 💙
    </p>

    <h2>📜 Introduction</h2>
    <p>Audition Toolkit is designed with one goal: to empower creators without compromising their privacy. We believe your music, your recordings, and your creative expressions are yours alone. Our app is built to process most features entirely offline, directly on your device, ensuring you remain in control of your data.</p>

    <h2>📂 Information Collection</h2>
    <p>Audition Toolkit does not collect personal information by default. All audio processing — whether it’s <strong>🎙️ voice changing</strong>, <strong>🎼 merging</strong>, <strong>✨ enhancing</strong>, <strong>✂️ cutting</strong>, or <strong>🔄 reversing</strong> — happens locally on your device.</p>
    <p>⚠️ The only exception is when you use the <strong>🎤 Karaoke</strong> feature. In this case, your selected audio is securely uploaded to our company’s private <strong>🏢 Quantalept</strong> server for advanced processing. Once your karaoke output is generated and returned to your device, the uploaded file is <strong>🗑️ immediately and permanently deleted</strong> from our server.</p>

    <h2>⚙️ Permissions</h2>
    <p>To deliver a seamless editing experience, Audition Toolkit may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>💾 Storage Access</strong> – To open, save, and export audio files.</li>
      <li><strong>🎤 Microphone Access</strong> – Only if you use the recording feature.</li>
      <li><strong>🌐 Internet Access</strong> – Required only for karaoke processing via Quantalept’s secure server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🤝 Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Audition Toolkit does not use any third-party advertising, analytics, or tracking tools. The only network connection is to our <strong>🏢 Quantalept</strong> infrastructure for karaoke processing. This infrastructure is fully owned, operated, and monitored by our team — ensuring no external parties have access to your data.</p>

    <h2>🛡️ Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data transfers for karaoke processing are 🔐 encrypted during transmission. Our secure deletion policy ensures that once the output is returned, no trace of your file remains on our servers.</p>

    <h2>📅 Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy to reflect improvements in our app and security practices. Any significant changes will be announced in the app before taking effect.</p>
